## Chapter 2: Standard DevOps Practices

### Video 3: Building containers from source code

This branch contains a script that uses [Podman](https://podman.io/) to login and pull a container from the integrated registry in [OpenShift Local](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview).

The file `demo.sh` requires the [paxtonhare/demo-magic](https://github.com/paxtonhare/demo-magic) project available locally.
