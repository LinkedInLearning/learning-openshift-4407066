If youâ€™re just getting started with Red Hat OpenShift, the Kubernetes-based enterprise platform as a service, you may be faced with a series of frustrating and exceedingly complex challenges. Because while OpenShift offers excellent security, cost effectiveness, and support features, it differs from Kubernetes in a number of critical ways. This course enables developers with Kubernetes experience to become proficient in OpenShift in a reasonably short amount of time. Get an overview of Red Hat OpenShift 4, exploring the major differences between it and Kubernetes. Along the way, instructor Adrian Kosmaczewski demonstrates how to start working with OpenShift 4 clusters, deploying applications, setting up CI/CD pipelines, working with operators and templates, monitoring services, and scaling applications.
